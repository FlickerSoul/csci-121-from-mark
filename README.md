## Overview

The goal of this course is to introduce you to the principles of computation. 
That includes teaching you to write a program, as well as how a computer
interprets and runs that program. Writing a program well can be a difficult
skill to master. You must understand the tools available to you, and you
must understand the principles of good design that allow those tools to be
used in manageable, understandable ways.

Our vehicle for building these skills will be programming in Python, which
is a good introductory language for a variety of reasons. First, it uses a
reasonably simple syntax, reducing the need to get bogged down in messy
details. Second, it is very flexible, allowing us to show you several
ways of writing programs. Finally, it’s a widely used language,
meaning that knowing it will be potentially quite useful to you after the
course. Given how much time we will spend programming in Python, you could
be excused for thinking this was simply a course in how to write Python
programs. It is not. There are some areas of programming (like graphical
interfaces) that are very useful for practical applications, but which do not
require any new conceptual understanding. We will largely be ignoring those
areas, though the course should make it easy for you to learn those things
on your own with some quick internet searches. We will also be covering some
topics which do little to aid in the writing of programs,
but which are important to the understanding of computation as a whole.

## Learning outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:
- write moderately complex programs using a high-level programming language
- write code using recursive functions, object-oriented programming, and 
  standard elementary data structures
- analyze the running time of simple programs
- organize and document their code

I also want to remind you that this course (and any college course)
requires and builds a variety of skills outside the specific course
content. These include, but are not limited to:
- reading and listening carefully
- thinking creatively and logically in order to solve difficult problems
- remembering relevant information
- persisting through challenging problems even when you are stuck
- managing time properly and being productive
- keeping track of assignments, communication, etc.
- working with other people effectively
- asking for help when you need it



## Coursework

**Sprints:** The course is organized into six "sprints," most of which
last two weeks (the exception is Sprint 4, which is three weeks, but
Wednesday, Mar 10 is a Reed-wide holiday). Each sprint culminates in a
50-minute quiz. The tentative timeline for the sprints is as follows:
- **Sprint 1**: Monday, Jan 25 to Friday, Feb 5
- **Sprint 2**: Monday, Feb 8 to Friday, Feb 19
- **Sprint 3**: Monday, Feb 22 to Friday, Mar 5
- **Sprint 4**: Monday, Mar 8 to Friday, Mar 26
- **Sprint 5**: Monday, Mar 29 to Friday, Apr 9
- **Sprint 6**: Monday, Apr 19 to Friday, Apr 30

**Homework:** Most Fridays, there will a homework set due. It will typically
be assigned during Tuesday lab, and the first part of the homework will be
done in collaboration with a partner during lab.

**Projects:** There will be three or four projects during the course. These
are more substantial assignments that will give you experience with creating
larger and more complex computer programs.

**Quizzes:** There will be six in-class quizzes throughout the course,
one per sprint. The tentative schedule for the quizzes:
- **Quiz 1**: Friday, Feb 5
- **Quiz 2**: Friday, Feb 19
- **Quiz 3**: Friday, Mar 5
- **Quiz 4**: Friday, Mar 26
- **Quiz 5**: Friday, Apr 9
- **Quiz 6**: Friday, Apr 30

**Final Exam:** There will be a three-hour cumulative exam during
finals week.


## Helpful Resources

### Course Webpage

The official course webpage is at:

[http://markandrewhopkins.com/csci-121-fundamentals-of-computer-science-i](http://markandrewhopkins.com/csci-121-fundamentals-of-computer-science-i/)

Lecture videos, reading assignments, homework assignments,
and projects will be regularly posted to the webpage.

### Slack

The Reed Computer Science Slack workspace has a channel called `#csci121`.
This is where I will post course announcements (including notifications that
the webpage has been updated). It is also a good forum for asking questions
to me, the course assistants, and your fellow students.

### Office Hours
My office hours this semester are Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday 4-6pm.
They will be by appointment. Sign up using [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU5mSjE1SFNSUk5xfGRlZmF1bHR8NzQ2MDU3MzJkYjQyOTkxOGE3OWViMzU0MDYxMTQxOWM).


### Drop-In Tutoring
Drop-in tutoring happens every weekday evening, Sun-Thurs from 7-9pm. 

### Individual/Small Group Tutoring
Every Reed student is entitled to one hour per week of individual tutoring
(or more with an accommodation) for every course, and you also have the
option to pool tutoring hours with other students in the class to do
multiple hours of small-group tutoring. Tutoring appointments can be
made at https://iris.reed.edu/tutor/tutors/profiles for any time and
place that works for you and your tutor. Please remember that tutors
are busy Reed students too, and really appreciate it when you try to
schedule appointments at least a few days in advance when possible.


### DOJO Study Skills Workshops and Coaching
Reed offers a variety of workshops as well as individual coaching to
help you learn study skills, time management, etc. Find further info 
[here](https://www.reed.edu/academic_support/index.html).





## Course Materials

The main offline learning material for the course will be videos that will be
posted on the course webpage. These will sometimes be augmented by notes
and readings. There is no official textbook, but I will assign certain passages
from Composing Programs, by John DeNero, which is freely available [here](http://www.composingprograms.com/).


## Miscellaneous

### Attendance

Attendance in lab and lecture is mandatory and absences will be penalized. 
There will also be material covered that is only discussed during the
lectures. If attendance is difficult for you, either long-term (say,
because of the time zone you are in) or temporarily, please talk to us.
If you will be missing class for an
excusable but foreseeable reason (say, a religious holiday), I expect you
will inform me prior to the absence.

### Collaboration and the Honor Code

Working on homework together can be useful and fun, and you
are encouraged to do it, but keep in mind the following:
- You are allowed to discuss homework with other 
  students and even help a classmate find a bug in their code. 
- You are **not** allowed to give code to each other. 
- Each student must write up homework independently, and must do the
  actual programming on the homework and projects independently (except
  for group assignments).
- Please acknowledge any collaborators when you submit homework/projects.

If you have any question about whether some level
of cooperation is acceptable, please ask.

You are also allowed to look up general background on the internet.
This can include looking up rules of Python syntax, for example.
However, you **cannot** use the internet to find code that is intended to
solve the problem you are trying to solve, or to copy such code.


### Disability Accommodations

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact your professor, and the
Office of Disability Support Services (`disability-services@reed.edu` or 
503-517-7921) as early as possible in the semester. Please be aware that 
requests may take several weeks to implement once
approved, and that accommodations are not retroactive.

### Covid-19 Policies

Because of all the meeting online, you need to have a stable high-speed
internet connection, a webcam, and a microphone on your computer so that 
you can meet with the instructors, tutors, and other students online.
You also need to be able to do the work on your own computer, meaning you
must have a computer of your own that runs a Windows, Mac, or Linux 
operating system. If you’re worried about these requirements, please talk
to me! I can try to get you what you need.

Students, staff, and faculty are expected to complete a 
health self-assessment each day to check for symptoms of COVID-19. This 
assessment tool will be available as a Qualtrics survey. 

If you need to miss a class, or series of classes, due to illness,
self-isolation, and/or quarantine, you are responsible for emailing me
to let me know as soon as possible.  You are also responsible for coordinating
with me to complete work that you might miss due to absences. It can be
tough to catch up after some time out of class, so let’s collaborate
to make a plan for getting up to speed.  

Finally, please let me know about any technical issues that might
hinder your success in the course.
