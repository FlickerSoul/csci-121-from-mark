# CSCI 121: Introduction to Computer Science

## Helpful resources (adapted from a document by Rhody Kaner)

### Mentors

We will be assigning each student a mentor who will provide you personalized
feedback for each project as the semester progresses. The list of
available mentors is [here](https://github.com/Mark-Hopkins-at-Reed/csci-121/blob/master/admin/mentors.md).

### Drop-In Tutoring
Drop-in tutoring happens every weekday evening, Sun-Thurs from 7-9pm in 
ETC 205. Come by any time during tutoring hours (even if you don’t have a 
question) to work on assignments around other CS students and get moral 
support from the community. 

### Individual/Small Group Tutoring 
Every Reed student is entitled to one hour per week of individual tutoring
(or more with an accommodation) for every course, and you also have the
option to pool tutoring hours with other students in the class to do
multiple hours of small-group tutoring. Tutoring appointments can be
made at https://iris.reed.edu/tutor/tutors/profiles for any time and place
that works for you and your tutor. Please remember that tutors are busy Reed
students too, and really appreciate it when you try to schedule appointments
at least a few days in advance when possible.

### DOJO Study Skills Workshops and Coaching

### Polytopia and The Math Lounge
Polytopia (Library 387) and the Math Lounge (Library, third floor, top of stairwell) 
are academic spaces for students in CS (and math) classes. These spaces are
often populated with other students working on similar coursework
(and sometimes upperclassfolk who can answer your questions), and these rooms
are conveniently on the same hallway as some of the CS professors' offices.
