# Using the autograder

Most of your projects and homeworks will be submitted to an online grading
system. Here we'll go through the steps involved in submitting a homework.

1. Go to cs.reed.edu and login using your Reed credentials.
2. You should see that there is an upcoming assignment due (if not, please
email hopkinsm@reed.edu):

3. Click on "attempt" (or "re-attempt", if you've already submitted a previous
solution). This should lead you to the following screen:

4. Each gray box represents a single exercise. Click on the text in a gray
box to expand the exercise's description.

5. Click on Choose File and find the file you want to submit. Then click on
Submit. You should arrive at the following screen:

6. Click on "results", which brings you to the following screen:

If you see a score of -1, that just means the results aren't quite ready
yet (just reload the page, and it should go away). If you get a perfect
score, then congratulations, you're done! Otherwise, the autograder will
indicate that something is incorrect about your program. Revise it, and
then go through the submission process again until you get it correct.
