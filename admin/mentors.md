# Mentors for CSCI 121

The following are the available mentors for the Spring 2020 offering of
CSCI 121. Your mentor will be here to provide you personalized feedback
on your projects as the semester progresses. Please send email to
hopkinsm@reed.edu by **Monday, February 3** to tell us your top 3
preferences -- otherwise, we will arbitrarily assign you to a mentor.
Not everyone will be able to get their top choice, but we'll do our best
to accommodate your preferences.


## Henry Blanchette

Henry Blanchette is a senior mathematics-compsci major. He is very 
interested in theoretical- and regular-compsci, and is happy to discuss 
it casually. Henry also has a hobby in programming languages.


## Jillian James

Hi! My name is Jillian James (she/her/hers) and I'm a senior Computer 
Science major. Besides being a TA/grader for this class I also tutor drop-in 
tutoring. CSCI 121 was my first introduction to computer 
science and to coding in general, so I understand how it is take this class 
without prior coding experience. A little about who I am outside of Reed: In 
my free time I like to kickbox and play video games and I'm learning to 
embroider. I also have a cat named Tink.


## Becca Luff

HI! I'm Becca Luff a sophomore Computer Science major. I took 121 last year
with Mark and Eric and ended up having a lot of fun! Computer science can sometimes seem 
unintuitive and the things your programs do can be confusing but with 
determination and creativity, we can figure it out together. My other 
hobbies and interests include music, politics, hiking, and fishing. Thank you 
for considering me and best of luck!

## Robert McCaull

Hi, I'm Robert McCaull (he/him/his), and I'm a junior CS major.  I took this
class in fall 2017 with Jim Fix, and I've tutored for it a few times since
then.  I have a fair amount of experience with programming, and I really
enjoy working on CS problems.  So, I'm always happy to help with projects,
or just talk about CS in general.  Outside of academics, I enjoy strategy
and role playing games, sailing, and walking in nature - among other things,
of course.  

## Hrishee Shastri

Some of you may know me, but my name is Hrishee (he/him/his) and I am a
junior. I took this course with Jim and Eitan, and I helped TA previously as
well. CS 121 can be a tough, fast paced environment with lots of moving parts--
and as culminations of what you have learned throughout the course, projects
may feel intimidating. As a course mentor, I'm hoping to focus on building
your skills and confidence rather than just pointing out errors. One of the
things I hope you'll discover is that it can be really fulfilling in the end! 
Apart from schoolwork I love playing soccer, losing at online chess,
and talking about different (human) languages. I'm also a big fan of
playing games as much as making them -- so I look forward to learning
with you all this semester!

## Kaiyan Shi

Hi, I am Kaiyan Shi, a senior math/CS major. I am interested in theoretical 
computer science, especially areas related to mathematics and physics. I had 
no past experience in computer science before CSCI 121, and so I could give 
advice based on my experience in CSCI 121 if you are a beginner.  Moreover, 
I have some experiences studying in both Budapest math and CS programs and I 
am happy to talk about it.
