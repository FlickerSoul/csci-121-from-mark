# Mentors for CSCI 121

The following are the available mentors for the Spring 2019 offering of CSCI 121. Your
mentor will be here to provide you personalized feedback on your projects
as the semester progresses. Please send email to hopkinsm@reed.edu by
**Friday, September 6** to tell us your top 3 preferences -- otherwise, we
will arbitrarily assign you to a mentor. Not everyone will be able to get
their top choice, but we'll do our best to accommodate your preferences.


## Henry Blanchette

Henry Blanchette is a senior mathematics-compsci major. He is very 
interested in theoretical- and regular-compsci, and is happy to discuss 
it casually. Henry also has a hobby in programming languages.


## Jillian James

Hi! My name is Jillian James (she/her/hers) and I'm a senior Computer 
Science major. Besides being a TA/grader for this class I also tutor drop-in 
tutoring on Thursday evenings. CSCI 121 was my first introduction to computer 
science and to coding in general, so I understand how it is take this class 
without prior coding experience. A little about who I am outside of Reed: In 
my free time I like to kickbox and play video games and I'm learning to 
embroider. I also have a cat named Tink.


## Henry Lindeman

Hi, I'm Henry Lindeman (He/Him), a sophomore math-cs major, I took 121 last year with Eric
and Mark so I have a good idea of what's going on. I also play trombone in both the 
orchestra and jazz ensemble here, and chess in the chess club, as well as 
having decent experience in other board games. I can't hear very well and 
accordingly am not a very good conversationalist, but if you request me I 
will attempt to help you succeed on stuff.


## Becca Luff

HI! I'm Becca Luff a sophomore Computer Science major I'll be in the 9 am Labs 
and Wednesday Night Drop-in tutoring. I took 121 Last year with Mark and Eric 
and ended up having a lot of fun! Computer science can sometimes seem 
unintuitive and the things your programs do can be confusing but with 
determination and creativity, we can figure it out together. My other 
hobbies and interests include music, politics, hiking, and fishing. Thank you 
for considering me and best of luck!

## Robert McCaull

Hi, I'm Robert McCaull (he/him/his), and I'm a junior CS major.  I took this
class in fall 2017 with Jim Fix, and I've tutored for it a few times since
then.  I have a fair amount of experience with programming, and I really
enjoy working on CS problems.  So, I'm always happy to help with projects,
or just talk about CS in general.  Outside of academics, I enjoy strategy
and role playing games, sailing, and walking in nature - among other things,
of course.  

## Kaiyan Shi

Hi, I am Kaiyan Shi, a senior math/CS major. I am interested in theoretical 
computer science, especially areas related to mathematics and physics. I had 
no past experience in computer science before CSCI 121, and so I could give 
advice based on my experience in CSCI 121 if you are a beginner.  Moreover, 
I have some experiences studying in both Budapest math and CS programs and I 
am happy to talk about it.
