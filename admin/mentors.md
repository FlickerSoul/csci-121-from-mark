# Mentors for CSCI 121

The following are the available mentors for the Spring 2019 offering of CSCI 121. Your
mentor will be here to provide you personalized feedback on your projects
as the semester progresses. Please send email to hopkinsm@reed.edu by
**Friday, February 8** to tell us your top 3 preferences -- otherwise, we
will arbitrarily assign you to a mentor. Not everyone will be able to get
their top choice, but we'll do our best to accommodate your preferences.


## Henry Blanchette

Henry Blanchette is a junior mathematics-compsci major. He is very 
interested in theoretical- and regular-compsci, and is happy to discuss 
it casually. Henry also has a hobby in programming languages.

## Ryen Burris

Hi everyone, I’m Ryen (they/them) and I’m a sophomore math/physics major. 
I took CSCI 121 last semester, before which I knew literally nothing about 
programming other than it seemed super scary to me. So if you’re in a 
similar position, don’t worry, you’re not alone! Outside of my studies, 
playing percussion is probably the most important thing in my life, so 
I’m a member of the Reed orchestra and The Academy drum and bugle corps. 
I also am an operator at Reed’s reactor, and I really enjoy film. Can’t 
wait to work with you all!

## Jillian James

Hi! My name is Jillian James (she/her/hers) and I'm a junior Computer 
Science major. Besides being a TA/grader for this class I also tutor drop-in 
tutoring on Thursday evenings. CSCI 121 was my first introduction to computer 
science and to coding in general, so I understand how it is take this class 
without prior coding experience. A little about who I am outside of Reed: In 
my free time I like to kickbox and play video games and I'm learning to 
embroider. I also have a cat named Tink.

## Rhody Kaner

Hi, I’m Rhody! I’m a Senior CS major, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. 
I’m very interested in CS education and want to help the CS department 
at Reed to be as diverse and welcoming as possible. I didn’t have any 
experience with CS before college and know how intimidating it can be to 
get into computer science when you don’t have a background in the subject 
or fit the archetype of a CS student. I’ve had some needlessly stressful 
times in CS classes, and I want to do what I can to help you avoid that 
stress and have a good experience in 121. On the rare occasions when I 
have free time, I enjoy cooking, reading, dance, craft projects, and 
playing with my roommate’s cat.

## Henry Lindeman

Hi, I'm Henry Lindeman (He/Him), a freshman, I took 121 last semester so I 
have a good idea of what's going on. I also play trombone in both the 
orchestra and jazz ensemble here, and chess in the chess club, as well as 
having decent experience in other board games. I can't hear very well and 
accordingly am not a very good conversationalist, but if you request me I 
will attempt to help you succeed on stuff.

## Hrishee Shastri

Some of you may know me, but my name is Hrishee (he/him/his) and I am a 
sophomore. I took this course exactly a year ago with Jim and Eitan, and 
I helped TA last semester as well. CS 121 can be a tough, fast paced 
environment with lots of moving parts-- and as culminations of what you 
have learned throughout the course, projects may feel intimidating. As a 
course mentor, I'm hoping to focus on building your skills and confidence 
rather than just pointing out errors. One of the things I hope you'll 
discover is that it can be really fulfilling in the end! 
Apart from schoolwork I love playing soccer, losing at online chess, and 
talking about different (human) languages. I'm also a big fan of playing 
games as much as making them -- so I look forward to learning with you 
all this semester!
