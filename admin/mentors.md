# Mentors for CSCI 121

The following are the available mentors for the Spring 2019 offering of CSCI 121. Your
mentor will be here to provide you personalized feedback on your projects
as the semester progresses. Please send email to hopkinsm@reed.edu by
**Friday, September 6** to tell us your top 3 preferences -- otherwise, we
will arbitrarily assign you to a mentor. Not everyone will be able to get
their top choice, but we'll do our best to accommodate your preferences.


## Henry Blanchette

Henry Blanchette is a senior mathematics-compsci major. He is very 
interested in theoretical- and regular-compsci, and is happy to discuss 
it casually. Henry also has a hobby in programming languages.


## Jillian James

Hi! My name is Jillian James (she/her/hers) and I'm a senior Computer 
Science major. Besides being a TA/grader for this class I also tutor drop-in 
tutoring on Thursday evenings. CSCI 121 was my first introduction to computer 
science and to coding in general, so I understand how it is take this class 
without prior coding experience. A little about who I am outside of Reed: In 
my free time I like to kickbox and play video games and I'm learning to 
embroider. I also have a cat named Tink.


## Henry Lindeman

Hi, I'm Henry Lindeman (He/Him), a sophomore, I took 121 last year with Eric
and Mark so I have a good idea of what's going on. I also play trombone in both the 
orchestra and jazz ensemble here, and chess in the chess club, as well as 
having decent experience in other board games. I can't hear very well and 
accordingly am not a very good conversationalist, but if you request me I 
will attempt to help you succeed on stuff.
